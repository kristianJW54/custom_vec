// NOTE: Custom implementation of a vec using unsafe
#![allow(unstable_features)]

// A Vec can be comprised of 3 levels
// Level 1: Public facing Vec the object a user interacts with - holding a buf and len for how many items are allocated
// Level 2: RawVec which holds a RawInner, a Cap for storing the capacity of a vec and a marker for the drop checker
// Level 3: RawInnerVec which handles the generic memory allocation and layout specificity

use std::alloc::{Allocator, Global};
use std::marker::PhantomData;
use std::ptr::{NonNull};
use std::cmp::{Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd};
use std::fmt::Alignment;
use crate::myvec::alignment::MyAlignment;
// For ZSTs there is zero allocation but a defined alignment
// A vec of Vec<()>::new() could be size = 0 but alignment = 1
// Allocators work in bytes so they give only non-zero-sized chunks of memory if we were to pass in a
// ZST the allocator would not know what to allocate but must provision for some memory so the trick is
// we let a capacity check handle this by setting capacity to 0..isize::MAX meaning set capacity to infinite
// as it doesn't matter because we are not actually allocating any actual memory

// For capacity handling, we need a type that stores capacity in a range that's safe for pointer arithmetic.
// In Rust's standard library, this is done using a niche optimization:
// the highest bit (the most significant bit) of a `usize` is always guaranteed to be zero
// because valid pointer offsets must be <= isize::MAX.
//
// Std can safely reserve that top bit as an unused niche.
// The compiler can then use that bit to represent `Option<Cap>::None` without
// increasing the size of the type (i.e., `Option<Cap>` stays the same size as `Cap`).
//
// In effect:
//   - All valid capacities are in 0..=isize::MAX (top bit = 0)
//   - `Option<Cap>::None` is represented by setting the top bit = 1
//   - If the top bit is ever set for a real capacity, we've overflowed and must fail
//
// This trick keeps `RawVec` compact and pointer-offsetâ€“safe without needing
// an extra tag field for `Option<Cap>`.

// We define a global capacity overflow panic to call whenever we encounter this
#[track_caller]
fn capacity_overflow() -> ! {
	panic!("capacity overflow");
}

// We use #![feature(rustc_attrs)] in lib.rs
// We do this so we can replicate the internally defined UsizeNoHighBit niche optimised type which reserves
// the top bit for the option tagging as mentioned above

// See [https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/raw_vec/mod.rs.html#40]
